\section{Conclusion} \label{section:conclusion}
    In this paper, we formalize an Uniswap-specific notion of orderflow information, as well as a metric for measuring it. We provide a conservative lower bound on the value that uninformed orders create for Uniswap LPs, and we use historical sandwich attack data to make a more robust lower bound on the value that uninformed orders create for Uniswap LPs. We then turn our attention to how much the protocol should value uninformed orderflow, and we provide a framework for valuing uninformed orderflow based on hypothetical protocol fees. We then discuss methods through which the protocol can incentivize uninformed orderflow.

    Uninformed orderflow can create immense value for the protocol. We hope that the Uniswap community can harness the frameworks and methodologies put forward here to harness this value to grow the protocol.
