    % The Uniswap protocol is composed of automated market maker where passive liquidity providers (LPs) earn fees proportional to the volume they fill.
    % % In order for the protocol's liquidity providers to remain on the protocol in the long run, they must earn enough fees to offset their losses. % TODO clean up the language here
    % Here, we compare the revenue that the impact that uninformed taker volume has on revenues for the protocol's liquidity providers, and conversely how much marginal liquidity we would expect as a result of increasing uninformed taker volume.
    % The Uniswap Protocol requires both market liquidity and price discovery, and it satisfies these requirements via liquidity providers (LPs) and arbitrageurs, respectively. LPs are incentivized by earning a fee proportional to the volume that they fill. 
    % It is existentially necessary to the Uniswap Protocol's long-term viability that its liquidity providers (LPs) make profit in expectation.
    % Uninformed orderflow, i.e. trades that are not predictive of future price movements, has a diffe
    We analyze how \textit{uninformed orderflow} -- Uniswap orders that are not predictive of future price movements on the Uniswap Protocol -- affects the trading fees generated on Uniswap pools.
    We also present an opinionated framework for how much the protocol should value this uninformed orderflow, as well as recommendations for how the protocol should implement uninformed orderflow incentive programs.
