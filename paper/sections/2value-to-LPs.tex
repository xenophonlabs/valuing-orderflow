\section{Value of Uninformed Orderflow for LPs} \label{section:lp-oflow-value}

% First, we determine the distribution of uninformed orderflow values from historical Uniswap behaviors 
% We sample from historical Uniswap trades to find the distribution of uninformed orderflow sizes. We outline our methodology for determining which orders are informed in the appendix.
% We sample from these historical trades to find the liquidity present at the time those swaps are made. We can use this to fit a function from swap size -> liquidity, although that regression may not be necessary / have statistical significance.
% We run simulations whereby we sample a swap size, compute the amount of fees that it generates for the LPs, and find the amount of capital per dollar.
% We then estimate the amount of additional liquidity we would expect in the pool, due to this increase in revenues. We do this in a rather unsophisticated way, by computing (new positions) = (new revenue)/(old revenue) * (old positions), and from this we could compute some liquidity metric L(new positions) and compare it to a liquidity metric L(old positions). However, this is almost certainly an over-estimation of the new liquidity, since it is unlikely that all of the original positions are linearly related to protocol revenues. We could do something to estimate which capital is _sticky_ vs _not sticky_ by instead just looking at (old positions | position has existed over a shorter term). These actively-managed positions are more likely to be elastic to LP revenues, and presumably they are managed by "smart money" market makers who would increase their capital deployed if there was an opportunity to earn more revenue. This does add another parameter to our problem -- the cutoff for how long a position has existed -- but we can see how it varies and adjust to something that's reasonable. We'll provide a couple different params. We'll choose an aggressively short term filter for the positions, then compute (new active positions) = (new revenue)/(old revenue) * (old positions), then compute (new positions) = (old positions - old active positions + new active positions), then compute L(new positions). This is the most practical approach we could derive for estimating the increase in LPs. Assumptions. (1) Uniswap uninformed swap size distribution will be the same in the future as it is today, (2) this liquidity model is sufficient to capture liquidity, (3) more like a possible issue is that we're not measuring gains to passive liquidity, (4) ?
% Another model for computing additional liquidity is to compute the PnL of LPing, see how this increases (in expectation) with more fee revenue, then see how you'd Markowitz-style optimize it, then see what the new liquidity positions would be. This would require an immense amount of assumptions though: uniform LP risk-reward preferences, uniform LP strategies, usage of a risk-free rate, etc.
